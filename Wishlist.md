# Wishlist

Things I want to add to the game, I don't expect to add everything in a short period of time though.

# Combat

- 3 playable characters, each with a few stat bonuses
  1. More damage per X levels, reduced weapon cooldown, start with sword
  2. More healing and movement speed per level, start hitscan
  3. More luck per X levels, start with slot machine
- Weapons
  - Sword that swings around the player
  - Meteor/lightning strikes
  - Hitscan that shoots in the facing direction
  - Bevy/a bunch of birds, chases enemies
  - Slot machine, when successful does an AoE attack

- At least 5 enemies, and 2 of them with special abilities
  - Zombie
  - Floating skull
  - Archer
  - Bomber
  - Construct
- Some enemies can spawn as a stronger variant

# Upgrade Items

- Base damage
- Weapon cooldown
- Duplicate projectiles
- Armor
- Movement speed
- Healing over time

# Both idle and active gameplay

I want there to be a way to progress even when you lose, or pause the game. Likely a farm which you can get to after dying to literally reap rewards for what you sowed.

- Unique seeds to upgrade your stats for (only) the next attempt, anything from damage to luck

# Loot

Stronger enemy variants drop treasure chests with weapons and upgrades inside
